<h1>What Type of Rods Should You Use?</h1>
<p>I am mainly going to talk about two brands of rods because there are hundreds of brands and there is not enough time to talk about them all. </p>
<p>The two rods I am going to talk about are G. Loomis Green-water and Shakespeare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>G. Loomis Green-water</p>
<p>The G. Loomis Green-water is my personal favorite rod. They are very lightweight and easy to cast with. </p>
<p>The length of the rod depends on what you buy, they come in all different sizes for different types of fishing. G. Loomis</p>
<p>are green and thin rods depending on the length. They range from $200-$500 per pole. If taken care of properly they will last you years.</p>

<p>Shakespeare </p>
<p>Shakespeare is like the bottom of the food chain. They are not very strong and they come in two pieces. When the rods are two pieces they become</p>
<p>even less reliable because they can come apart. The reels that come with the rod breaks constantly. The line gets tangled and it breaks. They range</p>
<p>from $20-$100 per rod. Even if taken care of properly they don't last that long.</p>
